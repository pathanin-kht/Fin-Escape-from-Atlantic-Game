## Overview
My first game project at Khon Kaen University, completed between September and October 2023, was a 2D game called "Fin: Escape from Atlantic." I developed it using the Godot Engine, featuring dynamic obstacles, power-ups, and score tracking. The game was published on itch.io for cross-platform play and smooth performance.

## Controls
- **PC**: Press the **Spacebar** key to dodge obstacles.
- **Mobile**: Tap anywhere on the screen to dodge obstacles.
  
## Gameplay Features
- **Dodge Stone**: If you dodge the stone, you earn +1 point. If you hit the stone, you die.
- **Collect Treasure**: Collect treasures to increase your score by +3 points.
- **Collect Bubble**: Gain a speed boost for 2 seconds when collecting bubbles.
- **Collect Bomb**: Avoid bombs, as they will decrease your score by -2 points.
